# Sentiment Weighting Reform - Summary of Changes

## Overview
This document summarizes the changes made to reduce sentiment weighting throughout the trading system, ensuring that sentiment analysis is used as a small boost rather than a deciding factor in trade decisions.

## Key Principles Applied
1. **Sentiment should never block trades** - only provide small enhancements
2. **Sentiment weights should be minimal** - typically 5-15% of total scoring
3. **Boost factors should be conservative** - maximum 25% increase instead of 50%
4. **Higher thresholds** - require better quality sentiment data for any boost
5. **Fail-safe defaults** - always return neutral sentiment if analysis fails

## Files Modified

### 1. `config/pump_sniper_config.yaml`
- **Decision weights**: Reduced `sentiment_score` from 0.15 to 0.08 (-47%)
- **Signal weights**: Reduced `social_sentiment` from 0.15 to 0.08 (-47%)
- **Redistributed weights** to other factors to maintain total at 1.0

### 2. `crypto_bot/solana/enhanced_scanner.py`
- **Base scoring weights**: Reduced `sentiment` from 0.10 to 0.05 (-50%)
- **Redistributed weights** to liquidity, volatility, momentum, and volume
- **New weights**: liquidity(0.28), volatility(0.22), momentum(0.22), volume(0.18), sentiment(0.05), spread(0.05)

### 3. `crypto_bot/config/lunarcrush_config.yaml`
- **Boost settings**: Reduced `max_boost` from 0.50 to 0.25 (-50%)
- **Thresholds**: Increased `min_galaxy_score` from 60.0 to 70.0, `min_sentiment` from 0.6 to 0.7
- **Pool scoring**: Reduced `weight_sentiment` from 0.3 to 0.15 (-50%)
- **Composite weights**: Reduced sentiment-related weights across the board

### 4. `crypto_bot/sentiment_filter.py`
- **Default thresholds**: Increased minimum requirements for any boost
- **Boost calculation**: More conservative formula with smaller ranges and higher divisors
- **Maximum boost**: Reduced from 50% to 25% increase
- **Documentation**: Added note about conservative design

### 5. `crypto_bot/solana/scanner.py`
- **Composite scoring**: Reduced sentiment weights in token scoring
- **New weights**: galaxy(0.35), sentiment(0.15), social(0.30), rank(0.20)
- **Sentiment impact**: Reduced from 30% to 15% of composite score

### 6. `crypto_bot/solana/score.py`
- **Default sentiment weight**: Reduced from 0.5 to 0.15 (-70%)
- **Pool scoring**: Sentiment now has minimal impact on final pool scores

### 7. `crypto_bot/solana/pump_detector.py`
- **Social sentiment impact**: Reduced by 50% in pump probability calculation
- **Signal analysis**: Sentiment now contributes much less to pump detection

### 8. `crypto_bot/main.py`
- **Sentiment boost application**: Added additional conservative factor (50% reduction)
- **Threshold enforcement**: Enforces higher minimum requirements for sentiment data
- **Logging**: Better tracking of conservative sentiment boost application

### 9. `crypto_bot/signals/signal_fusion.py`
- **Sentiment strategy detection**: Automatically reduces weights for sentiment-related strategies
- **Default multiplier**: 0.5x reduction for sentiment strategies
- **Configurable**: Can be adjusted via `sentiment_weight_multiplier` setting

### 10. `crypto_bot/utils/market_analyzer.py`
- **Sentiment boost reduction**: 70% reduction in sentiment impact on final scores
- **Conservative application**: Sentiment boosts are heavily dampened
- **Debug logging**: Tracks when conservative sentiment boosts are applied

### 11. `crypto_bot/config/sentiment_config.yaml` (NEW FILE)
- **Centralized configuration**: All sentiment settings in one place
- **Conservative defaults**: Pre-configured for minimal sentiment impact
- **Strategy overrides**: Different settings for different trading strategies
- **Documentation**: Clear guidance on making sentiment even less impactful

## Impact Summary

### Before Changes
- Sentiment could contribute up to 30% of scoring decisions
- Boost factors could increase scores by up to 50%
- Lower quality sentiment data could still provide significant boosts
- Sentiment was often a deciding factor in trade execution

### After Changes
- Sentiment typically contributes 5-15% of scoring decisions
- Boost factors are limited to maximum 25% increase
- Only high-quality sentiment data (Galaxy Score ≥70, Sentiment ≥0.7) provides boosts
- Sentiment is now truly just a small enhancement, not a deciding factor

## Configuration Options

### Conservative Mode
```yaml
sentiment:
  max_boost_factor: 0.15
  weights_multiplier: 0.5
```

### Aggressive Mode (Still Conservative)
```yaml
sentiment:
  max_boost_factor: 0.30
  weights_multiplier: 1.2
```

### Disable Sentiment
```yaml
sentiment:
  enabled: false
```

## Monitoring and Validation

### Log Messages to Watch
- "Applied conservative sentiment boost X.XXX for SYMBOL"
- "Reduced sentiment strategy weight for STRATEGY: X.XXX"
- "Applied conservative sentiment boost X.XXX to SYMBOL"

### Metrics to Track
- Percentage of trades that receive sentiment boosts
- Average sentiment boost factor applied
- Impact of sentiment on final trade scores
- Performance comparison between sentiment-boosted and non-boosted trades

## Future Adjustments

If sentiment is still too impactful, consider:
1. Further reducing `max_boost_factor` to 0.15 or 0.10
2. Applying `weights_multiplier: 0.5` to reduce all sentiment weights by 50%
3. Increasing minimum thresholds for Galaxy Score and sentiment scores
4. Increasing the boost calculation divisor for smaller boosts
5. Completely disabling sentiment for certain strategies

## Conclusion

These changes ensure that sentiment analysis serves its intended purpose as a small enhancement to trading decisions rather than a major factor. The system now relies primarily on technical analysis, market conditions, and risk management, with sentiment providing only minor positive reinforcement for high-quality opportunities.
